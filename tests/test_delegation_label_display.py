"""Tests for delegation label display formatting.

Covers M0 from docs-local/02-delegated-agentname-colorization/01-research/:
- interactive_session colorizes the printed label and stores the normalized form.
- session_worker emits the plain normalized form (no ANSI) for channel events.
- slack_client uses the normalized form (no ANSI) for Slack messages.

These tests directly exercise the small format helper extracted from
``interactive_session._format_task_label`` and the call sites in
``session_worker.py`` and ``slack_client/handlers/commands.py``.  They avoid
spinning up the full SDK message-stream loop because that requires an
installed ``claude_agent_sdk`` and a long async ``ClaudeSDKClient`` setup —
the smaller helper covers the same logic with one assertion per test.
